# 0x16. C - Simple Shell :rocket:

## Description

This project is an implementation of the shell created as a Milestone Project for the C code at ALX Africa Software Engineering.
The gates of shell is a project in the first trimester, that helps student to understand the advanced concepts behind the shell program include process, system call, bit manipulation, file managment, error handling ...
Shell is a simple UNIX command interpreter that replicates functionalities of the simple shell (sh).
This program was written entirely in C Language.

And Thanks ALX for this amazing oppurtunity.

## Description :

This is a shell written in C. It is based on the Thompson Shell, with the help of ALX ressources/materials.

## Environment :

Our shell was built and tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.

## Features

- Display a prompt and wait for the user to type a command. A command line always ends with a new line.
- If an executable cannot be found, print an error message and display the prompt again.
- Handle errors.
- Hndling the “end of file” condition (Ctrl+D)
- Hanling the command line with arguments
- Handle the PATH
- Support the exit features and the exit status
- Handle the Ctrl-C to not terminate the shell
- Handling the command seperator ;
- Handling && and || logical operators
- Handle variable replacements $? and $$
- Handle the comments #
- Support the history feature
- Support the file input
###Note: 
Not all these functionnalities could be done, but we realized most of them.

## Builtins

Our shell has support for the following built-in commands:

| Command      | Definition                                                                 |

## Basic usage :bulb:

- First, Fork this Repository [Learn how to fork repo](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo).
- Then Clone [Learn how to clone](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository).
- Create an executable by running the following command:
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o hsh
